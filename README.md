# styledwindcss
Enables the use of any version of tailwindcss with any version of @emotion/styled

The inspiration for this project came from twin.macro. Unlike their approach, this package allows you to use any version of tailwindcss with any version of @emotion/styled. You need to install those packages independently in addition to styledwindcss.

## install
npm install tailwindcss
npm install @emotion/react
npm install @emotion/styled
npm install styledwindcss
